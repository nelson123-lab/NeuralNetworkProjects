# Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch

This is an object-oriented implementation of a Neural Network using NumPy.      
For simplification the functions of the Neural Network are very similar to use as Keras for the supported features.

### Type of Layers: 
- Dense
- Conv2d
- Flatten

### Supported Activation Functions: 
- Sigmoid
- ReLU (and leaky ReLU)
- Softmax

### Supported Loss Functions: 
- Mean-Squared-Error
- Categorical-Cross-Entropy

###
There are also many comments in the code for clarity.     
Note: This project is not yet finished, I will implement some features and fix bugs soon.
